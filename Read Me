This project was created as part of CodeCademy's computer science course. 

I followed the instructions for the project at the beginning but then added some additional functionality to the program.

Currently this code allows you to create Pokemon and Trainers and battle, revive, and level them up. 

In the future, I hope to turn this into a fully functioning text based Pokemon game. I currently do not have the knowledge base to make it useable outside of the code itself, though.
